## Git Branching Modell - Feature Branching

- Each team has its own dedicated branch.
- There are five projects, each housed in its own subfolder to avoid merging conflicts.
- After completing a feature, teams merge their updates into the main branch.
- Teams should notify others vai MS Teams when they release a new feature that could be important for teams.
- To utilize features developed by other teams, a team should merge these updates into their own branch.
