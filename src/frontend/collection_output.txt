  Document:  What does it mean to have a Bitcoin? Many people have heard of Bitcoin; that it's a fully digital currency  with no government to issue it, that no banks need to manage accounts  and verify transactions, and that no one really knows who invented it. And yet, many people don't know the answer to this question, at least not in full.

  Document: might have invented your own version of Bitcoin.  We'll start with you keeping track of payments with your friends using a communal ledger,  and then as you start to trust your friends and the world around you less and less,  and if you're clever enough to bring in a few ideas from cryptography to help circumvent  the need for trust, what you end up with is what's called a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is just the first implemented example of a cryptocurrency,  and now there are thousands more on exchanges with traditional currencies.

Walking the path of inventing your own can help to set the foundations  for understanding some of the more recent players in the game,  and recognizing when and why there's room for different design choices. In fact, one of the reasons I chose this topic is that in the last year there's  been a huge amount of attention, investment, and hype directed at these currencies.

  Document: down to earth:  ledgers and digital signatures.  If you and your friends exchange money pretty frequently,  paying your share of the dinner bill and such,  it can be inconvenient to exchange cash all the time. So you might keep a communal ledger that records all the  payments you intend to make at some point in the future. Alice pays Bob $20, Bob pays Charlie $40, things like that. This ledger is going to be something public and accessible to everyone,  like a website where anyone can go and add new lines.

If you spent more than you received, you put that money in the pot,  and if you received more than you spent, you take that money out. So the protocol for being part of this very simple system might look like this:  Anyone can add lines to the ledger, and at the end  of every month you all get together and settle up.

So what's to prevent Bob from going and writing  "Alice pays Bob $100" without Alice approving? How are we supposed to trust that all of these  transactions are what the sender meant them to be? Well, this is where the first bit of cryptography comes in: digital signatures.

Like handwritten signatures, the idea here is that Alice should be able to add  something next to that transaction that proves that she has seen it and that she's  approved of it, and it should be infeasible for anyone else to forge that signature. At first, it might seem like a digital signature shouldn't even be possible. I mean, whatever data makes up that signature can just be read and copied by a computer. So how do you prevent forgeries?

  Document: by a computer. So how do you prevent forgeries?  Well, the way this works is that everyone generates what's called a  public key-private key pair, each of which looks like some string of bits. The private key is sometimes also called a secret key,  so we can abbreviate it as SK, while abbreviating the public key as PK. As the name suggests, this secret key is something you want to keep to yourself. In the real world, your handwritten signature looks  the same no matter what document you're signing.

  Document:  the same no matter what document you're signing.  But a digital signature is actually much stronger,  because it changes for different messages. It looks like some string of 1s and 0s, commonly something like 256 bits,  and altering the message even slightly completely changes what  the signature on that message should look like. Speaking a little more formally, producing a signature involves a  function that depends both on the message itself and on your private key.

The private key ensures that only you can produce that signature,  and the fact that it depends on the message means that no one can  just copy one of your signatures and forge it on another message. Hand-in-hand with this is a second function used to verify that a signature is valid,  and this is where the public key comes into play. All it does is output true or false to indicate if this was a signature produced  by the private key associated with the public key you're using for verification.

Specifically, there's no strategy better than just guessing and checking  random signatures, which you can check using the public key that everyone knows. Now think about how many signatures there are with a length of 256 bits. That's 2 to the power of 256! This is a stupidly large number.

In fact, I made a supplemental video devoted just  to illustrating what a huge number this is.

If Alice signs a transaction like "Alice pays Bob $100,"  even though Bob can't forge Alice's signature on a new message,  he could just copy that same line as many times as he wants. That message-signature combination remains valid. To get around this, we make it so that when you sign a transaction,  the message has to include some sort of unique ID associated with that transaction.

Great, digital signatures remove a huge aspect of trust in this initial protocol. But even still, if you were to really do this,  you would be relying on an honor system of sorts. Namely, you're trusting that everyone will actually follow  through and settle up in cash at the end of each month.

But no one has ever figured out a way to do that. Interestingly, there's no cold, hard, rigorous proof  that it's hard to compute in the reverse direction. And yet, a huge amount of modern security depends on cryptographic  hash functions and the idea that they have this property.

If you were to look at what algorithms underlie the secure connection  that your browser is making with YouTube right now,  or that it makes with your bank, you'll likely see the name SHA256 show up in there. For right now, our focus will be on how such a function can prove that a particular  list of transactions is associated with a large amount of computational effort.

Imagine someone shows you a list of transactions, and they say, "Hey,  I found a special number so that when you put that number at the end of this list of  transactions, and apply SHA256 to the entire thing,  the first 30 bits of that output are all zeros."  How hard do you think it was for them to find that number? Well, for a random message, the probability that a hash happens to start  with 30 successive zeros is 1 in 2 to the 30, which is about 1 in a billion.

That is, a special number so that the hash of  the whole block starts with a bunch of zeros.

For the moment, let's say it has to start with 60 zeros,  but later we'll return back to a more systematic way you might want to choose that number. In the same way that a transaction is only considered valid when it's signed  by the sender,  a block is only considered valid if it has a proof of work. Also, to make sure there's a standard order to these blocks,  we'll make it so that a block has to contain the hash of the previous block at its header.

That way, if you were to go back and change any one of the blocks,  or to swap the order of two blocks, it would change the block that comes after it,  which changes the block's hash, which changes the one that comes after it, and so on. That would require redoing all of the work, finding a new special number  for each of these blocks that makes their hashes start with 60 zeros. Because blocks are chained together like this,  instead of calling it a ledger, it's common to call it a blockchain.

This signature is presumably generated using a private key (sk), indicated by a padlock icon and the label 'sk'.  The  `Verify(Message, 256 bit Signature, pk) = True` equation shows a verification function taking the message, the 256-bit signature, and a public key (pk) as inputs and returning 'True', indicating successful verification that the message originates from the holder of the private key. This illustrates the core principle of digital signatures, a crucial aspect of AI security for authentication and ensuring data integrity.  The visual representation effectively connects the binary data representing the signature to the verification process and its outcome, highlighting how AI systems can utilize cryptography for secure communication and data protection.

This value is input into the SHA256 cryptographic hash function, which transforms it into a long string of binary digits (a hash). The probability of generating a hash with a specific number of leading zeros (here, approximately 30) is extremely low, represented as 1/2^230. This low probability makes it computationally expensive to find a valid "proof of work," providing security and preventing fraudulent transactions. The process demonstrates how cryptographic hashing is used to secure transactions within a blockchain system, a key aspect of many AI-related applications in decentralized finance.
